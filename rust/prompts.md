## Adding javascript support

The idea of this educational game is to help kids learn JavaScript (and other programming languages in the future) and algorithms.
The application is a top-down, pixel-art-style RPG game where a user can control the main goblin character by programming his behavior in JavaScript.

To implement such functionality help me to add javascript interpretator to my application. Research, which crate I can use for my Rust based application. It should support defining rust functions call. For example, when an user call move_east(), or move_right() function in JS, it should call Rust character function fn move_east().
